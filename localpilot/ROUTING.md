# LocalPilot: How the Router Decides Local vs Cloud

The router answers one question for every coding request:

> **Can the small model on my laptop handle this, or do we need to pay for a big cloud model?**

It works in two stages:

1. **Before calling any model**, score how hard the request looks (0 = trivial, 1 = very hard).
2. **After calling the local model**, check whether the local model sounds confident. If it doesn't, escalate to the cloud.

Everything is rule-based: no training and no extra ML model. Every decision comes with plain-English `reasons`, so the UI can show *why* each request was routed the way it was.

## The full flow

```text
Request (prompt + optional code + optional repo_path)
   │
   ▼
1. Task Analyzer ──► complexity score (0..1) + reasons
   │
   ▼
2. Decide
   ├─ score < 0.35          → LOCAL
   ├─ 0.35 ≤ score ≤ 0.65   → LOCAL FIRST (cloud if local is unsure)
   └─ score > 0.65          → CLOUD
   │
   ▼
3. Context optimizer: pick the relevant files, keep them under a 3,000-token budget
   │
   ├─ LOCAL / LOCAL FIRST ─► Ollama (qwen2.5-coder:7b)
   │                          returns {answer, confidence, needs_cloud}
   │                          │
   │                          ├─ confidence ≥ 0.7 and needs_cloud = false → return local answer ✅
   │                          └─ otherwise (or Ollama crashed)            → ESCALATE to cloud
   │
   └─ CLOUD ─────────────────► Cloud LLM with the optimized context only
   │
   ▼
4. Response + metrics (route, confidence, tokens sent and saved, latency, reasons)
```

Code: [`app/analyzer.py`](app/analyzer.py) (scoring), [`app/router.py`](app/router.py) (decision and escalation), [`app/llm.py`](app/llm.py) (model calls and confidence).

## Stage 1: The complexity score

The score is a weighted sum of four factors. Each factor is between 0 and 1:

```text
weighted = 0.40 × task_type  +  0.20 × reasoning  +  0.20 × context_size  +  0.20 × files
score    = max(weighted, 0.8 × task_type)        ← "strong task signal" floor (only when complex keywords matched)
```

**Why the floor?** Without it, a prompt with no code attached has context_size = files = 0, so it could never score above 0.6. That means it could never go to the cloud, however hard the task. The floor makes sure a clearly hard task (e.g. "refactor the architecture across the codebase", task_type = 1.0 → score ≥ 0.8) still routes to the cloud with no code attached.

### Factor 1: Task type (40%), the biggest signal

We look for keywords in the prompt. Each keyword has a difficulty value:

| Complex keywords (examples) | Value | Simple keywords (examples) | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| architecture, system design, race condition, deadlock, whole codebase | 1.0 | hello world | 0.0 |
| migrate, vulnerability, memory leak, concurrency, multiple files | 0.9 | typo | 0.05 |
| refactor, security, codebase, end-to-end | 0.8 | rename, docstring, one-liner | 0.1 |
| rewrite, performance, optimize, across, entire, authentication | 0.7 | explain, comment, format, syntax | 0.15–0.2 |
| debug, bug, crash, implement, feature | 0.6 | regex, convert | 0.3 |
| fix | 0.5 | unit test | 0.35 |

The rules:
- **Any complex keyword found:** take the highest value, then **add 0.05 for each extra complex keyword** (capped at 1.0). Several hard signals together make the task harder.
- **Exactly one complex keyword plus a simple keyword** (e.g. "*explain* this *race condition*"): blend 75% complex and 25% simple. The task is still hard, just slightly less so.
- **Only simple keywords:** take the lowest (easiest) value.
- **No keywords at all:** 0.45, a neutral "medium" guess.

### Factor 2: Reasoning (20%)

Does the request need multi-step thinking?

```text
reasoning = max( words_in_prompt / 120 ,  reasoning_markers_found / 3 )     (each capped at 1)
```

Reasoning markers: *why, trade-off, compare, best approach, step by step, should I, pros and cons, root cause, and then, first, also*.

### Factor 3: Context size (20%)

How much code comes with the request: the selected code plus the whole repo, if one is attached.

```text
context_size = total_tokens / 8000      (capped at 1)
```

A 7B local model gets noticeably worse with large contexts, so at 8k+ tokens this factor is maxed out.

### Factor 4: Files (20%)

```text
files = files_mentioned_in_prompt / 4                      (e.g. "auth.py", "routes.ts")
if a repo is attached: files = max(files, min(repo_files / 50, 0.6))
```

### Worked examples (real outputs)

**"Write a Python one-liner to reverse a string"**

| Factor | Value | × Weight |
|---|---|---|
| task_type ("one-liner") | 0.10 | 0.040 |
| reasoning (8 words) | 0.067 | 0.013 |
| context_size | 0 | 0 |
| files | 0 | 0 |
| Weighted sum | | 0.053 |
| **Score** (no complex keywords, so no floor) | | **0.053 → LOCAL** |

**"Refactor the routing architecture across the codebase to support multiple cloud providers and explain the trade-offs"**, with a repo attached:

| Factor | Value | × Weight |
|---|---|---|
| task_type (5 complex keywords: 1.0 + 4×0.05, capped) | 1.00 | 0.400 |
| reasoning ("trade-off" = 1 marker) | 0.333 | 0.067 |
| context_size (~6,400 tokens) | 0.80 | 0.160 |
| files (8-file repo) | 0.16 | 0.032 |
| Weighted sum | | 0.659 |
| **Score** = max(0.659, 0.8 × 1.0) | | **0.80 → CLOUD** |

## Stage 1b: User consent in the UI (Streamlit demo)

The UI first calls `POST /analyze`. This is a dry run: it returns the decision, reasons and token estimates **without calling any model**. Then:

| Decision | What the UI does |
|---|---|
| `local` (score < 0.35) | Shows a "Simple task: using the local LLM" notification and answers locally. |
| `local_first` (0.35–0.65) | Answers locally too. If the local model's confidence is below 0.7, it shows a **"Retry with global LLM"** button. |
| `cloud` (score > 0.65) | **Asks the user.** It shows the reasons and how many tokens would be sent, with two buttons: **Use local** and **Use global (recommended)**. |

Nothing is sent to the cloud unless the user clicks a "global" button. In the UI, every `/chat` call uses `force_route`, so the API never escalates on its own. The automatic escalation in Stage 2 only applies to API clients that use `force_route: "auto"`.

---

## Stage 2: Confidence-based escalation

For requests routed **LOCAL** or **LOCAL FIRST**, we ask the local model to answer in this JSON shape:

```json
{"answer": "...", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "needs_cloud": true/false}
```

Small models tend to overrate their confidence, so we adjust the number they give:
- **−0.4** if the answer is under 20 characters (empty or near-empty)
- **−0.1 per hedging phrase**, up to 3: *"I'm not sure", "might be", "it depends", "without more context", "unclear"*...

**We escalate to the cloud if any of these are true:**
- adjusted confidence **< 0.7**
- the local model itself says `needs_cloud: true`
- Ollama failed (crashed, timed out, not running)

When we escalate, the user still gets an answer, from the cloud. The response shows `escalated: true` and the reason.

---

## Stage 3: Only relevant context goes to the cloud

Before anything goes to the cloud, the context optimizer (Person 2's module) picks only the files relevant to the prompt and keeps them within a **3,000-token budget**. The current fallback ranks files by keyword matches. Person 2's version will add smarter selection, compression and secret redaction.

How we measure the savings:

```text
original_tokens = prompt + ALL code/repo        (what a normal cloud-only assistant would send)
sent_tokens     = tokens actually sent to cloud (0 if answered locally)
tokens_saved    = original_tokens − sent_tokens
```

Real example: the refactor request above would have sent **6,454** tokens. LocalPilot sent **2,972**, which is **54% fewer**.

## Why this works: pros and cons

### Pros

| Pro | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Most coding requests are simple** | Explaining code, writing docstrings, renames, small snippets and regexes are a large share of everyday requests. A 7B coding model handles these well, so they never reach the cloud. |
| **Two safety nets** | The upfront score catches obviously hard tasks. The confidence check catches tasks that *looked* easy but weren't. Each one covers mistakes the other misses. |
| **Explainable** | Every decision lists its reasons, e.g. "complex task keywords: refactor, architecture" or "context size ~6,400 tokens". No black box. Good for the demo and easy to debug. |
| **Fast and free to decide** | Scoring takes under a millisecond and costs nothing. Using an LLM to make the routing decision would itself cost tokens and time. |
| **Easy to tune live** | Thresholds and weights are plain numbers in `.env` and `analyzer.py`. If a demo prompt routes wrong, we fix it in seconds. |
| **Fails safely** | If Ollama is down, requests automatically go to the cloud. Users always get an answer. |
| **Privacy by default** | Simple requests never leave the laptop. Cloud requests carry only the relevant files, not the whole repo. |

### Cons, and how we'd fix them

| Con | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Keyword matching is shallow** | "Fix this typo in the auth module" contains "auth" and "fix", so it scores higher than it should. Phrasing we haven't listed falls back to the neutral 0.45. | Tune the keyword list on real prompts. Later: a small embedding classifier trained on logged requests. |
| **Small models are overconfident** | In testing, qwen2.5-coder:7b almost always reports 0.9–1.0, so the confidence check rarely triggers. | Blend in the complexity score, e.g. `0.7 × self_confidence + 0.3 × (1 − score)`. Or run a quick self-check: ask the local model to verify its own answer. |
| **Hand-picked weights and thresholds** | The 0.35 / 0.65 thresholds and the 40/20/20/20 weights are educated guesses, not learned from data. | Run a set of labelled demo prompts and adjust. Log every decision so we could fit the weights later. |
| **"Local first" can be slow** | A big local answer takes 60s or more on a laptop. If it then escalates, the user waits for both models. | Limit local answer length. Or run local and cloud in parallel for the middle band and cancel whichever isn't needed. |
| **No check that the answer is correct** | High confidence doesn't mean the answer is correct. | Future: run generated code or tests, check syntax, or have the cloud model review local answers on a sample. |

**One-line summary for the pitch:** cheap rules filter out the easy requests, the local model's own uncertainty catches the borderline ones, and the cloud only sees the hard ones, with trimmed context.

## Setting up the real cloud provider

### Claude or Gemini?

**Important: a Claude Pro subscription does NOT include API access.** Pro covers the claude.ai apps (and Claude Code). The API is a separate product with separate, pay-as-you-go billing through the Claude Console. So the real choice is between these:

| | **Claude API** (recommended if you can spend ~$5) | **Gemini API free tier** (recommended if you can't spend anything) |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | Pay as you go. Sonnet 5.5: $2 / $10 per million input / output tokens. Opus 5.5: $4 / $20. | Free tier with rate limits (via Google AI Studio) |
| Demo cost estimate | ~50 cloud calls × (3k in + 1k out) ≈ **$0.80 (Sonnet 5.5)** or **$1.60 (Opus 5.5)** | $0 |
| Coding quality | Excellent | Good |
| Code changes needed | None. Already built in (`CLOUD_PROVIDER=anthropic`). | None. Uses our OpenAI-compatible mode (`CLOUD_PROVIDER=openai`). |
| Fit with our pitch | Paid API traffic isn't used for training by default. Fits the "protect your code" message. | Free-tier prompts **may be used by Google to improve its products**. That slightly undercuts a pitch about not sending your code to the cloud. Check the current terms. |

**Recommendation:** use the **Claude API** with a small prepaid credit (also ask the hackathon organizers whether they provide API credits). It's the best coding quality, the demo costs a couple of dollars, and it fits the privacy story. If nobody can add a card, use **Gemini's free tier**. Switching later is just a change to `.env`.

### Option A: Claude API

1. Go to **console.anthropic.com**, sign in, open **Billing**, and add credits.
2. Go to **API Keys**, click **Create Key**, and copy it (it starts with `sk-ant-`).
3. In `localpilot/`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:
   ```bash
   CLOUD_PROVIDER=anthropic
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5-5   # or claude-opus-5-5 for the strongest answers
   CLOUD_MAX_TOKENS=16000
   ```
4. Restart the server (`uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`) and test:
   ```bash
   curl -s localhost:8000/health
   curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/chat -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"prompt":"Design an architecture for a rate limiter", "force_route":"cloud"}'
   ```
   The response should show `"model": "claude-sonnet-5-5"` instead of `mock-cloud`.

Notes:
- Keep `CLOUD_MAX_TOKENS` high (16000). Newer Claude models can think before answering, and that thinking counts toward the limit. A low cap can cut the answer off.
- **Never commit `.env`.** It's already in `.gitignore`.

### Option B: Gemini (free tier)

1. Go to **aistudio.google.com**, click **Get API key**, then **Create API key**.
2. Set `.env` (Gemini offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so our existing code works unchanged):
   ```bash
   CLOUD_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your Gemini key>
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai
   OPENAI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash      # check AI Studio for the current model names
   ```
3. Restart the server and run the same `curl` test as above.

### Mock mode

`CLOUD_PROVIDER=mock` (the default) returns a placeholder cloud answer after 1.2s. Use it to build and test the UI without spending anything.
